# Double Sample Dilated Pyramid Network Code

This network is a detector for pollen recognition on the electron microscope pollen images.

In this work, we design a novel fusion pyramid that merge the dilated pyramid with the multi-views pyramid.

The designed fusion pyramid codes are in files dudpn/DPN_fs.py and dudpn/DPN_Mergebn.py

Referring to zylo117  <https://github.com/zylo117/Yet-Another-Efficient-Pytorch>, we compile the codes of our proposed structure DUDPN and take the DPN into the backbone.py.
